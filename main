<p>Alex Sherman, reporting for CNBC: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fewer than 10,000 people are using CNN+ on a daily basis two weeks into its existence, according to people familiar with the matter. The people spoke with CNBC on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss nonpublic data.</p>

<p>CNN+ launched on March 29. The subscription news streaming service, which charges $5.99 a month or $59.99 annually, only became available on Roku on Monday and still isn’t on Android TV. Still, the paltry audience casts doubt on the future of the application following the recently completed combination of Discovery and WarnerMedia into Warner Bros. Discovery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s an interesting idea. People <em>do</em> pay monthly subscription fees to watch exclusive entertainment and sports content on streaming services. Might not they pay for streaming news, too? Perhaps not. 10,000 users per day is crickets-chirping territory for CNN.</p>

<p>Ben Volin, reporting for The Boston Globe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Feb. 1, Tom Brady announced that he was stepping away from football. The Buccaneers moved ahead with Bruce Arians as head coach and assessed their options at quarterback.</p>

<p>By March 30, Brady was back with the Bucs, preparing to play his 23rd NFL season at age 45. And his head coach was Todd Bowles after Arians retired and took a consulting job with the team.</p>

<p>How did this drastic turn of events take place in just two months? This wasn’t a Brett Favre situation, with Brady walking away for several months before getting the itch again during training camp. Brady was “retired” for all of 40 days, and came back in time for the Buccaneers to be active in free agency.</p>

<p>Instead, Brady’s change of heart was the result of a fascinating fall of dominos involving the Miami Dolphins, Sean Payton, Brian Flores’s lawsuit, former Patriots offensive lineman Rich Ohrnberger, and a Manchester United soccer match.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This story is kind of bananas on the surface, but makes sense. The real fly in the ointment of the whole scheme was Brian Flores’s discrimination lawsuit against the Dolphins and the NFL. If not for that, today Tom Brady might be part-owner of the Dolphins and their starting quarterback next season — in the same division as the Patriots. But Flores’s lawsuit was at least <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/sport/brian-flores-lawsuit-nfl-racial-discrimination-spt/index.html">partially precipitated by an errant text message sent to him by … Bill Belichick</a>!</p>

<p>Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, in a tweet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Elon has decided not to join our board. I sent a brief note to the
company, sharing with you all here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first thing I’ll note is that Agrawal had to share the “brief note” itself as a screenshot, because, well, Twitter only supports up to 280 characters in a post. Duh, right? We all know that. But it’s really kind of silly when you consider that even Twitter’s own CEO, sharing important breaking news, has to use screenshots to share even a “brief note”. (The seemingly obvious solution would be to allow users to include a text attachment to a tweet, the same way we’ve been able to attach images and videos for years.)</p>

<p>From the note:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We announced on Tuesday that Elon would be appointed to the Board
contingent on a background check and formal acceptance. Elon’s
appointment to the board was to become officially effective 4/9,
but Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be
joining the board.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is the “background check” relevant here? Like, did something turn up in the background check that Twitter deemed problematic? The simple explanation is that Musk simply realized that he could have freer rein — and thus more fun, and more influence — <em>not</em> on the board than on it. But why mention the background check at all here then? Just as a jab — a not-so-subtle dig?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I believe this is for the best. We have and will always value
input from our shareholders whether they are on our Board or
not. Elon is our biggest shareholder and we will remain open to
his input.</p>

<p>There will be distractions ahead, but our goals and priorities
remain unchanged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Translation: <em>We are largely beholden to Elon Musk now, as our stock price is inextricably tied to his continuing shareholding.</em></p>

<p>I mean what happens to Twitter’s share price if Musk dumps all his stock and tweets something like “I tried to help Twitter but the company is run by a bunch of bozos. I’m out.” That’s just 76 characters and I bet it would tank Twitter’s stock.</p>

<p>Matt Levine, in his Money Stuff column for Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look this all makes complete sense, obvious, intuitive, simple sense. If you are the richest person in the world, and annoying, and you constantly play a computer game, and you get a lot of enjoyment and a sense of identity from that game and are maybe a little addicted, then at some point you might have some suggestions for improvements in the game. So you might leave comments and email the company that makes the game saying “hey you should try my ideas.” And the company might ignore you (or respond politely but not move fast enough for your liking). It might occur to you: “Look, I am the richest person in the world; how much could this game company possibly cost? I should just buy it and change the game however I want.” Even if your complaints are quite minor, why shouldn’t you get to play exactly the game you want? Even if you have no complaints, why not own the game you love, just to make sure it continues to be exactly what you want? The game is Twitter, the richest person in the world is Elon Musk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think anyone in the media gets Elon Musk the way Matt Levine does.</p>

<p>Ben Thompson, last week on Stratechery:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meanwhile, subscriber growth has stalled, even as the advertising market has proven to be much larger than even Google or Facebook can cover. Moreover, the post-ATT world is freeing up more money for the sort of top-of-funnel advertising that would probably be the norm on a Netflix advertising service. In short, the opportunity is there, the product is right, and the business need is pressing in a way it wasn’t previously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thompson and I talked about this on <a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a> last week, and I think this is a fascinating question. The first thing to note is that the “Netflix should sell ads” take that Thompson espouses is about adding new lower-priced tiers that are subsidized through commercials — <em>no one</em> is arguing that Netflix should add ads to existing subscription tiers. Basically, what’s being suggested is the Hulu model: pay something to get access but with ads, or pay more to get access without any ads at all.</p>

<p>When you keep that point in mind, as a business case, it makes a lot of sense for Netflix to expand this way. My argument against Netflix doing this is about <em>brand</em>, though. Netflix has built an incredibly valuable brand, and part of that brand’s foundation is that Netflix is a premium service that doesn’t do rinky-dink shit like force you to watch unskippable ads. When you’re a Netflix customer, Netflix is always on your side. Unskippable ads are not on your side. Ergo Netflix should never create a lower-priced-with-ads subscription tier. Yes, they’d add more subscribers that way, and goose revenue growth for a few more years, but I think the revenue they’d gain would be outweighed, significantly, by the brand equity they’d lose in doing so. Netflix isn’t just like Hulu or Peacock or any of the also-ran services with ads. Netflix is fucking Netflix, <em>the</em> leading streaming service.</p>

<p>There’s no way to account for brand value on a balance sheet, but great CEOs know what it’s worth in their guts, and savvy investors should too.</p>

<p>Craig Hockenberry, commenting on the WWDC 2022 poster image:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one has commented on this yet, but I bet there’s a new SF
variant in June.</p>

<p>I guessing that SF Wide will look great on slides…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The “Call to Code” slogan is set in what appears to be a new wide variant of San Francisco, Apple’s family of fonts that it uses for everything from the OS system font (MacOS, iOS, WatchOS, and tvOS) to packaging to advertising. Can’t believe I didn’t notice this.</p>

	<summary type="text">A diverse broadcast crew, including Melanie Newman calling play-by-play, but no pausing or fast-forwarding during games.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/04/apple-introduces-broadcasters-and-production-details-for-friday-night-baseball/">Apple Newsroom, yesterday</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beginning Friday, April 8, the broadcast team of Melanie Newman
(play-by-play), Chris Young (analyst), Hannah Keyser (analyst),
and Brooke Fletcher (reporter) will call the New York Mets at the
Washington Nationals at 7 p.m. ET; and Stephen Nelson
(play-by-play), Hunter Pence (analyst), Katie Nolan (analyst), and
Heidi Watney (reporter) comprise the crew that will call the
Houston Astros at the Los Angeles Angels game at 9:30 p.m. ET.
Game assignments for “Friday Night Baseball” broadcasters will be
announced on a weekly basis. In her new role with “Friday Night
Baseball,” Newman becomes the second woman to lead play-by-play
duties for a national broadcast team; she joined the Baltimore
Orioles’ broadcast team in 2020.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A diverse announcing crew, for sure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Produced by MLB Network’s Emmy Award-winning production team in
partnership with Apple, “Friday Night Baseball” will offer a
modern and dynamic broadcast experience that appeals to new
viewers and veteran fans alike. Each game broadcast will employ
state-of-the-art cameras, including high-speed Phantoms, the
high-resolution Megalodon, and more throughout the season to
present vivid, live-action shots, and offer immersive sound in 5.1
with spatial audio enabled. “Friday Night Baseball” will also
incorporate new on-screen graphics that include innovative new
probabilities-based forecasts of different situational outcomes,
plus highlights and live look-ins from around the league
integrated right into the broadcast. Throughout the “Friday Night
Baseball” broadcasts, fans can enjoy on-screen callouts about
batters’ walk-up songs from Apple Music, test their knowledge of
baseball trivia with help from Siri, and more. And, in a first for
MLB games, “Friday Night Baseball” will feature rules analysis and
interpretation from former MLB umpire Brian Gorman.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That all sounds good, but on Twitter, streaming media analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/DanRayburn/status/1512450898928283659">Dan Rayburn reports some disappointing news</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple says their Friday Night exclusive MLB games that kick off
tonight on Apple TV+ will not support “Pause, fast forward, and
other playback controls aren’t available with Friday Night
Baseball.” That seems odd.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jason Snell (among many others) <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2022/04/apple-provides-new-friday-night-baseball-details/">notes that Apple makes no mention of 4K streaming</a>, either, which strongly suggests that for now at least, all games will be in 1080p. The lack of pause and fast-forwarding is a technical issue that’s entirely in Apple’s hands, I think. (I don’t think they support those features in live-streamed event keynotes, either.) The lack of 4K (and HDR) might be more of a league-wide infrastructure issue — I’m not sure if <em>any</em> regular season MLB games are broadcast on TV or streamed in 4K.</p>

<p>Excited to see how this goes, and how Apple can improve the technology of “Friday Night Baseball” as the season proceeds.</p>

	<summary type="text">Baby steps, but all of these changes are in the direction of decreasing regulatory pressure. Apple can be stubborn but they’re not stupid.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Apple last week adjusted its proposed plan for compliance with the Netherlands ACM’s regulations on dating apps. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=jmps5hyj">Three changes were announced</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li><p>Removal of the Separate Binary Requirement: Apple is eliminating
the requirement that developers of dating apps in the
Netherlands who choose to use the above entitlements must create
and use a separate binary. This change means that developers may
include either entitlement in their existing dating app, but
still must limit its use to the app in the Netherlands
storefront and on devices running iOS or iPadOS.</p></li>
<li><p>Payment Service Provider Criteria: Apple is providing updated
and more-specific criteria to evaluate non-Apple payment
service providers that developers of dating apps in the
Netherlands may use.</p></li>
<li><p>Consumer Disclosures: Apps that use either entitlement need to
include an in-app modal sheet that explains to users that
they’re going to make purchases through an external payment
system, and the potential impact that choice could have on the
user. Apple is adjusting the language on the modal sheet and
reducing the number of times the sheet must be displayed.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>None of these proposed changes are earth-shattering, but they’re all for the better.</p>

<p>Apple’s initial proposal that apps using these entitlements in the Netherlands would need to do so using a separate binary — meaning, a second Netherlands-only version of the app — seemed deliberately confusing. One problem with requiring a separate binary, for example, is that Dutch users who already have one or more dating apps installed might not have gotten updated versions that use these new entitlements via software update. There are some popular apps in the App Store with multiple binaries, but it’s unusual. Sometimes it’s a split between a free/lite version and a paid/pro version, but that’s less common these days, where the typical strategy is a free-to-download-and-use version that contains an in-app purchase to unlock additional features or remove ads.</p>

<p>The other notable change is to the required language in the warning screen users must be presented before making purchases via non-Apple payment processors or being sent to the web. Here’s the <em>previous</em> version of the warning screen (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/02/going_dutch">which I wrote about two months ago</a>): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Title:</b> This app does not support the App Store’s private and
secure payment system</p>

<p><b>Body:</b> All purchases in the &lt;App Name&gt; app will be managed by
the developer “﹤Developer Name﹥.” Your stored App Store payment
method and related features, such as subscription management and
refund requests, will not be available. Only purchases through the
App Store are secured by Apple.</p>

<p>Learn More</p>

<p>Action 1: Continue <br />
Action 2: Cancel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s the updated version, from Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement/">developer page for the StoreKit External Purchase Entitlement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Title:</b> This app doesn’t support the App Store’s payment system.</p>

<p><b>Body:</b> All purchases in this app will be managed by the developer
“&lt;Developer Name&gt;.” You will no longer be transacting with
Apple. Your stored App Store payment method and related features,
such as subscription management and refund requests, will not be
available. Apple is not responsible for the privacy or security of
transactions made with this developer.</p>

<p>Learn More</p>

<p>Action 1: Continue <br />
Action 2: Cancel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The changes to this language are subtle, but good. “This app doesn’t support the App Store’s payment system” is simply true. As I wrote in February, the old title sort of implied not just that Apple’s payment system is private and secure, but that <em>only</em> Apple’s payment system is private and secure. The new language is more matter-of-fact, which feels appropriate.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, though, Apple still hasn’t said what’s supposed to happen if a user taps on “Learn More”.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=grjqafts">Apple also last week announced an update</a> on “reader” app distribution, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/01/apple-anti-steering-relaxation">pursuant to their agreement last September with the Japan Fair Trade Commission</a>. Apple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last year, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/japan-fair-trade-commission-closes-app-store-investigation/">announced</a> an update coming to the App Store
in early 2022 that would allow developers of “reader” apps to
include an in-app link to their website for account creation and
management purposes. Starting today, with the update of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#reader-apps">App Store
Review guideline 3.1.3(a)</a>, developers of reader apps can now
request access to the External Link Account Entitlement. This
entitlement lets reader apps link to a website that is owned or
maintained by the developer, so that users can create or manage
their account outside of the app. Reader apps are apps that
provide one or more of the following digital content types — magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, or video — as the
primary functionality of the app.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/reader-apps/">Learn about the External Link Account Entitlement</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Baby steps, but all of these changes are in the direction of decreasing regulatory pressure. Apple can be stubborn but they’re not stupid.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a>’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign
in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently

pretty proud of this one.</p>

<p>For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the
home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to
revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later
update.)</p>

<p>Chris Isidore, CNN Business:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Elon Musk recently purchased 9.2% of Twitter stock, according to a
filing Monday, making him the largest shareholder in the company.</p>

<p>News of the purchase sent shares of Twitter soaring 22% in early
trading. Musk did not disclose what he paid for the shares, but
his stake was worth $2.9 billion as of the close of trading
Friday, and $3.5 billion after the spike early Monday.</p>

<p>He does keep things interesting.</p>

<p>Tim Bray:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I was working at AWS, around 2017 we started getting excited
pitches from companies who wanted to be part of the 5G build-out,
saying that obviously there’d be lots of opportunities for
public-cloud providers. But I never walked away convinced. Either
I didn’t believe the supposed customers really needed what 5G
offered, or I didn’t believe the opportunity was anywhere near big
enough to justify the trillion-dollar build-out investment. Six
years later, I still don’t. This is a report on a little online
survey I ran, looking for actual real-world 5G impact to see if I
was wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bray collected a lot of comments from various readers. Most of them seem to agree with Bray (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/23/5g-battery-life">and me</a>) that 5G offers no substantial practical advantages over LTE. There are some people who report getting good 5G coverage in remote locations that have poor LTE coverage, and 5G seemingly does work much better than LTE in places like stadiums and arenas with big crowds of people.</p>

<p>Alex Heath, reporting for The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A group of Facebook engineers identified a “massive ranking
failure” that exposed as much as half of all News Feed views to
“integrity risks” over the past six months, according to an
internal report on the incident obtained by The Verge.</p>

<p>The engineers first noticed the issue last October, when a sudden
surge of misinformation began flowing through the News Feed, notes
the report, which was shared inside the company last week. Instead
of suppressing dubious posts reviewed by the company’s network of
outside fact-checkers, the News Feed was instead giving the posts
distribution, spiking views by as much as 30 percent globally.
Unable to find the root cause, the engineers watched the surge
subside a few weeks later and then flare up repeatedly until the
ranking issue was fixed on March 11th.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It really does sound like a bug, and some bugs really are devilishly tricky to track down and fix. But it seems a bit odd that it took Facebook six months to fix this one, given how intense the scrutiny of the company has gotten for the very problem this bug made worse.</p>

<p>Meg James and Amy Kaufman, reporting for the LA Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to those who have worked with the elder Willis on his recent films, the actor has been exhibiting signs of decline in recent years. In interviews with The Times this month, nearly two dozen people who were on set with the actor expressed concern about Willis’ well-being. […]</p>

<p>Jesse V. Johnson, who directed the low-budget film “White Elephant,” first worked with Willis decades ago when he was a stuntman. But when the filmmaker and the actor met briefly before shooting began in Georgia last April, “it was clear that he was not the Bruce I remembered,” Johnson said. Concerned about Willis’ mental state, he said he approached the actor’s team — which is led by his assistant-turned-handler Stephen J. Eads — and bluntly asked about the actor’s condition.</p>

<p>“They stated that he was happy to be there, but that it would be best if we could finish shooting him by lunch and let him go early,” Johnson recalled of the conversation. Filmmakers proceeded to quickly film the actor’s parts, even as Willis questioned where he was: “I know why you’re here, and I know why you’re here, but why am I here?” two crew members said he asked aloud.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sad story, but it explains Willis’s seemingly-odd low-budget film choices in recent years. According to The Times, Willis made 22 movies in 4 years.</p>

<p>I’ve been a huge Bruce Willis fan ever since <em>Moonlighting</em> (a show that, to my mind, doesn’t get nearly the credit it deserves for ushering in the modern era of “prestige TV”). Willis had the <em>it</em> that all great acting stars do: once you saw him in a role, it was impossible to imagine anyone else playing that part.</p>

<p>Chris Welch, writing for The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This morning, I received a very blatant spam text offering me “a
little gift” for supposedly paying my phone bill. Normally I’d
groan, roll my eyes, and quickly delete such a thing, but there
was something different about this particular message: it was
spoofed as coming from my own phone number. As best my iPhone
could tell, it was a legitimate message from me to myself. Tapping
into the sender details took me to my own contact card. [...]</p>

<p>Turns out I wasn’t alone. Many customers on Verizon have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/tplkdg/spam_from_my_own_number/">reported
getting similar spam</a> from their respective numbers over the
last few days — same for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Visible/comments/tpqhv3/spam_text_from_my_own_number/">its MVNO Visible</a> — and several
<em>Verge</em> employees on other carriers have also encountered them. I
posted an Instagram story about it and have gotten plenty of
“same” responses. SMS phishing, or “smishing,” <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7appv/sms-phishing-is-getting-out-of-control">has been on the
rise</a> in recent years, but there’s something more disconcerting
and invasive about it being linked to your own number. It’s all
very “the call is coming from inside the house.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got the same exact spam over the weekend, but instead of coming from my personal phone number (which is indeed on Verizon), it came to my personal phone number <em>from</em> my Google Voice number. Spooky, to say the least.</p>

<p>My wife got the same spam over the weekend too, from her own number to her own number, and for a moment, it was really freaky, because she had previously only texted herself to send photos from one device to another. So the whole chain of messages above the spam message made it look like the spammer was somehow sending her photos from her own photo library.</p>

	<title>Matthew Panzarino’s Interview With Apple Execs Regarding the Mac Studio and Studio Display</title>

<p>Matthew Panzarino, writing for TechCrunch two weeks ago (I’m just now digging out of my hardware reviews catch-up):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We look very much at Mac studio for what it is, a completely new
Mac product line. Which is rare. We don’t add product lines to the
Mac very often,” says Tom Boger, Vice President of Mac &amp; iPad
Product Marketing at Apple. “Our philosophy was not at all to take
a Mac Mini and scale it up, it was ‘we know we’re working on this
M1 Ultra chip and we want to bring it to those users who want
performance and conductivity and a modular system. And let’s allow
it to live right on people’s desks so it’s within easy reach. And
that’s what we delivered.”</p>

<p>I spoke to Boger, along with Shelly Goldberg, Senior Director, Mac
and iPad Product Design, and Xander Soren, Director of Product
Marketing, Pro Apps at Apple about the design and development of
Mac Studio.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Panzarino’s take, combined with the interview, really nails the ways that the Mac Studio and Studio Display fill important spots in the Mac hardware lineup that have long been vacant.</p>

<p>Taylor Lorenz and Drew Harwell, reporting for The Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Facebook parent company Meta is paying one of the biggest
Republican consulting firms in the country to orchestrate a
nationwide campaign seeking to turn the public against TikTok.</p>

<p>The campaign includes placing op-eds and letters to the editor in
major regional news outlets, promoting dubious stories about
alleged TikTok trends that actually originated on Facebook, and
pushing to draw political reporters and local politicians into
helping take down its biggest competitor. These bare-knuckle
tactics, long commonplace in the world of politics, have become
increasingly noticeable within a tech industry where companies vie
for cultural relevance and come at a time when Facebook is under
pressure to win back young users. [...]</p>

<p>Targeted Victory needs to “get the message out that while Meta is
the current punching bag, TikTok is the real threat especially as
a foreign owned app that is #1 in sharing data that young teens
are using,” a director for the firm wrote in a February email.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all know that the smart way to alter the opinions of today’s teenagers is to ... place op-eds in local newspapers around the country.</p>

<p>Recall too that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/technology/george-soros-facebook-sheryl-sandberg.html">Facebook was caught using a Republican smear-campaign firm back in 2018</a> — their target then was George Soros.</p>

<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple and Major League Baseball (MLB) today announced the first
half of the 2022 “Friday Night Baseball” schedule. These scheduled
games are available to anyone with internet access, for free, only
on Apple TV+. “Friday Night Baseball” will premiere April 8 with
two marquee games: the New York Mets versus the Washington
Nationals, live from Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., beginning
at 7 p.m. ET, featuring the anticipated Mets debut of three-time
Cy Young Award-winner and eight-time All-Star Max Scherzer taking
on All-Star Juan Soto and the Nationals; and the Houston Astros
versus the Los Angeles Angels, live from Angel Stadium, beginning
at 9:30 p.m. ET, featuring three-time American League MVP Mike
Trout and reigning American League MVP Shohei Ohtani and the
Angels taking on Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman and the defending
American League Champion Astros. “Friday Night Baseball,” a weekly
doubleheader, will be available to fans in eight countries
exclusively on Apple TV+ on Fridays throughout the regular season.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that Japan is one of the eight countries where Friday Night Baseball will be streamed, it’s no surprise that the Angels — with the sensational Shohei Ohtani — are on the schedule three times in the first half of the season.</p>

<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2022/03/the-first-friday-night-baseball-games-are-set/">Jason Snell has a few good questions</a>, including who’s going to be in the broadcast booths for these games, and who’ll be hosting the pre- and post-game shows. Snell also makes note of how interesting it is that the games on this initial schedule will be available free to everyone with the Apple TV app, even if they’re not TV+ subscribers.</p>

<p>Grant Schulte, reporting for the AP:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Nebraska state lawmaker apologized on Monday after he publicly
cited a persistent but debunked rumor alleging that schools are
placing litter boxes in school bathrooms to accommodate children
who self-identify as cats.</p>

<p>Sen. Bruce Bostelman, a conservative Republican, repeated the
false claim during a public, televised debate on a bill intended
to help school children who have behavioral problems. His comments
quickly went viral, with <a href="https://twitter.com/jonnykip21/status/1508485363177861124">one Twitter video</a> garnering more
than 300,000 views as of Monday afternoon, and drew an onslaught
of online criticism and ridicule. [...]</p>

<p>“They meow and they bark and they interact with their teachers in
this fashion,” Bostelman said during legislative debate. “And now
schools are wanting to put litter boxes in the schools for these
children to use. How is this sanitary?”</p>

<p>The rumor has persisted in a private Facebook group, “Protect
Nebraska Children,” and also surfaced last month <a href="https://www.kcrg.com/2022/02/11/superintendent-denies-rumors-litter-boxes-restrooms-students-who-identify-cats/">in an Iowa
school district</a>, forcing the superintendent to write to
parents that it was “simply and emphatically not true.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those today who believe whatever nonsense they see on Facebook are like the people who, a generation ago, believed the nonsense printed in supermarket tabloids like “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_World_News">The Weekly World News</a>”. The difference is that instead of being crackpots who write letters to elected officials, a bunch of them today <em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/campaign-chronicles/can-anyone-unseat-marjorie-taylor-greene">are</a></em> elected officials.</p>

<p>Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, reporting for The Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Internal White House records from the day of the attack on the U.S. Capitol that were turned over to the House select committee show a gap in President Donald Trump’s phone logs of seven hours and 37 minutes, including the period when the building was being violently assaulted, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post and CBS News.</p>

<p>The lack of an official White House notation of any calls placed to or by Trump for 457 minutes on Jan. 6, 2021 – from 11:17 a.m. to 6:54 p.m. – means the committee has no record of his phone conversations as his supporters descended on the Capitol, battled overwhelmed police and forcibly entered the building, prompting lawmakers and Vice President Mike Pence to flee for safety. […]</p>

<p>In a statement Monday night, Trump said, “I have no idea what a burner phone is, to the best of my knowledge I have never even heard the term.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not a fan of <em>The Wire</em>, apparently.</p>

<p>I didn’t watch the show, but I’ll bet this is all anyone is talking about regarding the Oscars today.</p>

<p>Adam Engst, writing at TidBITS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alas, in macOS 11 Big Sur, Apple decided to hide the proxy icon by default, forcing you to hover over the window title for a second to make the proxy slide in from the left. It was discovered that this Terminal command could make the delay shorter, though hovering is still required.</p>

<pre><code>defaults write -g NSToolbarTitleViewRolloverDelay -float 0
</code></pre>

<p>I use proxy icons a lot, but I missed the online chatter that included this Terminal command, so I’ve been quietly muttering at Apple every time I waited for a proxy icon to appear. More frustrating is that I also missed the fact that Apple silently provided an option to bring back proxy icons completely in macOS 12 Monterey. I was recently helping a TidBITS reader who didn’t know about Reduce Transparency in System Preferences → Accessibility → Display when I saw another checkbox that was new to me: Show Window Title Icons.</p>

<p>Jane Mayer, reporting for The New Yorker:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Several of the country’s most respected legal scholars say that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas must immediately recuse himself from any cases relating to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/2020-election">the 2020 election and its aftermath</a>, now that it has been revealed that his wife, Virginia (Ginni) Thomas, colluded extensively with a top White House adviser about overturning <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/11/16/the-biden-era-begins">Joe Biden’s victory</a> over then President Donald Trump. On March 24th, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/24/virginia-thomas-mark-meadows-texts/">Washington <em>Post</em></a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/virginia-ginni-thomas-clarence-wife-mark-meadows-texts-2020-election/">CBS News</a> revealed that they had obtained copies of twenty-nine text messages between Ginni Thomas and Mark Meadows, the Trump White House chief of staff, in which she militated relentlessly for invalidating the results of the Presidential election, which she described as an “obvious fraud.” It was necessary, she told Meadows, to “release the Kraken and save us from the left taking America down.” Ginni Thomas’s texts to Meadows also refer to conversations that she’d had with “Jared”—possibly Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who also served as a senior adviser to the Administration. (“Just forwarded to yr gmail an email I sent Jared this am.”)</p>

<p>Stephen Gillers, a law professor at N.Y.U. and a prominent judicial ethicist, described the revelations as “a game changer.” In the past, he explained, he had supported the notion that a Justice and his spouse could pursue their interests in autonomous spheres. “For that reason, I was prepared to, and did tolerate a great deal of Ginni’s political activism,” he said. But “Ginni has now crossed a line.” In an e-mail reacting to the texts, Gillers concluded, “Clarence Thomas cannot sit on any matter involving the election, the invasion of the Capitol, or the work of the January 6 Committee.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we thought it was bad back in 1991 when we learned <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anita-hill-vs-clarence-thomas-the-backstory/">he joked to his employees about pubic hair being planted on his can of Coke</a>.</p>

<p>Signal founder Moxie Marlinspike, on Twitter a month ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Telegram is the most popular messenger in urban Ukraine. After a
decade of misleading marketing and press, most ppl there believe

<p>The reality is the opposite — TG is by default a cloud database
w/ a plaintext copy of every msg everyone has ever sent/recvd.</p>

<p>Every msg, photo, video, doc sent/received for the past 10 yrs;
all contacts, group memberships, etc are all available to anyone
w/ access to that DB.</p>

<p>Many TG employees have family in Russia. If Russia doesn’t want to
bother w/ hacking, they can leverage family safety for access.</p>

<p>Sam Schechner and Tim Higgins, reporting last week for The Wall Street Journal (<a href="https://apple.news/AjwI1hwp9RISCJiqgGwEvVQ">News+</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new European Union legislation — which could be effectively
completed as soon as this month — is set to direct Apple to allow
software to be downloaded outside its cash-generating App Store
and limit how companies impose their own payment systems on apps,
according to people involved in the negotiations. Failure to
comply would carry penalties of up to tens of billions of dollars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not the sort of fines Apple can just pay from the loose change in Luca Maestri’s couch.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rivals and critics of Apple’s power hope the EU law will serve as
a catalyst for other jurisdictions, such as in the U.S., where
similar legislation is pending before Congress.</p>

<p>“Apple is playing 5D chess right now,” said Paul Gallant, a policy
analyst for Cowen &amp; Co. “It will struggle to explain why
government changes will radically change the iPhone when Google
already does it and it will struggle to explain why it can’t do it
in the United States when it may soon do it in Europe.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a dumb quote. First, what the hell is the fifth dimension? It’s like he was going to say “4D chess” — which itself is a poor metaphor, given that regular chess is complex enough and takes place in two dimensions — and decided to give it some extra oomph. Second, the iPhone <em>is</em> different from Android. It is true that the fact that Android supports sideloading doesn’t seem to adversely affect typical Android users, but one of Apple’s core arguments against legally mandated sideloading is that it would remove from the market a choice to buy devices where sideloading is not possible. Third, no one from Apple has ever once argued that they “can’t” enable sideloading on iOS because that’s obviously nonsense. They don’t want to enable it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The full effect of the sideloading provision isn’t yet clear as
lawmakers work on final language defining security exceptions that
could give Apple leeway to limit the scope of sideloading.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s really the rub.</p>

<p>Eliot A. Cohen, writing for The Atlantic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The evidence that Ukraine is winning this war is abundant, if one
only looks closely at the available data. The absence of Russian
progress on the front lines is just half the picture, obscured
though it is by maps showing big red blobs, which reflect not what
the Russians control but the areas through which they have driven.
The failure of almost all of Russia’s airborne assaults, its
inability to destroy the Ukrainian air force and air-defense
system, and the weeks-long paralysis of the 40-mile supply column
north of Kyiv are suggestive. Russian losses are staggering — between 7,000 and 14,000 soldiers dead, depending on your source,
which implies (using a low-end rule of thumb about the ratios of
such things) a minimum of nearly 30,000 taken off the battlefield
by wounds, capture, or disappearance. Such a total would represent
at least 15 percent of the entire invading force, enough to render
most units combat ineffective. And there is no reason to think
that the rate of loss is abating — in fact, Western intelligence
agencies <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/20/russia-ukraine-military-offensive/">are briefing</a> unsustainable Russian casualty rates of
a thousand a day.</p>

<p>Sam Roberts, writing for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was instrumental in prodding Tandy to venture into the computer
market. At the time, most small computers were sold as kits to be
assembled by hobbyists, but Mr. Roach believed that consumers
would welcome a model that they just needed to plug in.</p>

<p>His team presented the original TRS-80 prototype — cobbled
together from a black-and-white RCA monitor, a keyboard and a
videocassette recorder — to Tandy’s chief executive, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/06/archives/charles-tandy-60-industrialist-started-work-at-12-400-radio-shacks.html">Charles
Tandy</a>, and to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/business/lewis-kornfeld-made-radio-shack-an-early-player-in-pcs-dies-at-97.html">Lewis Kornfeld</a>, the president of
RadioShack, in January 1977.</p>

<p>The Apple 1 had been introduced the year before, and Commodore and
other companies were marketing their own home computers, but the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/25/archives/com-puters-find-a-home-yours-the-computer-finds-a-home-yours.html">TRS-80</a> (the initials stood for Tandy RadioShack) quickly
became, for a time, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/04/garden/doing-the-homework.html">the most popular computer on the market</a>.</p>

<p>“Charles blew a little smoke and said, ‘Build a thousand and if we
can’t sell them, we will use them in the store for something,’”
Mr. Roach recalled in remarks to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRWmYOzm16E">Fort Worth Executive Round
Table</a> last month. “We were finally able to ship some machines
in September and shipped 5,000 that year, all we could assemble,”
Mr. Roach said. “Our competitors shipped none.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The links in the passage above are not to be missed, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/25/archives/com-puters-find-a-home-yours-the-computer-finds-a-home-yours.html">this 1977 Times story on home computers</a>. But the last one is the most interesting — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRWmYOzm16E">it’s a YouTube video of a speech Roach gave just last month</a>. He’s funny as hell. Glad to see he was active and sharp right up to the end.</p>

<p>As a kid, the TRS-80 was, for whatever reason, the personal computer I had the least exposure to. I had friends with Commodore 64’s and my school had a bunch of Texas Instruments TI-99/4A’s and a precious handful of Apple II’s, but to my recollection I only ever saw a TRS-80 when I was inside a Radio Shack. But you can be damn sure when I did, I played with it until my parents dragged me out of the store.</p>

<p>Juli Clover, writing for MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The full report is limited to those in the display industry who
subscribe, but display analyst Ross Young provided a bit of color
on what can be expected. Apple is working on a MacBook Air that’s
somewhere around 15 inches in size, with the machine set to debut
alongside a “slightly larger” 13-inch MacBook Air.</p>

<p>According to Young, the larger-sized 15-inch MacBook Air is slated
for release in 2023, but a specific launch date unknown. This is
not the first time that we’ve heard about a 15-inch MacBook Air,
as Bloomberg’s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/23/apple-developing-15-inch-macbook-air/">Mark Gurman said last year</a> that Apple was
working on a larger MacBook Air with a 15-inch display size. [...]</p>

<p>Internal Apple emails that came out during the Epic Games
v. Apple trial also indicate that Apple considered a larger
15-inch MacBook Air <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/03/mac-tablet-larger-macbook-air-ipod-super-nano/">as early as 2008</a>, but instead went
with the smaller 13-inch model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Out of all the devices Apple could make but doesn’t, the one that I think might prove the most popular is a big consumer MacBook. Apple has never made a 15-inch or larger laptop that wasn’t a pro-specced and pro-priced MacBook Pro or PowerBook. Surely there are a lot of people out there who would buy a MacBook Air with a 15-inch display if one existed. Plus, now that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/10/the_2021_14-inch_macbook_pro">the latest MacBook Pros have gained a wee bit of thickness and weight</a> in the interest of better serving pro users’ needs, there’s room for a thinner, lighter large-display MacBook to stand out. But why wait for 2023? I’d love to see such a thing appear later this year, when M2 MacBooks are unveiled.</p>

<p>The current MacBook Air (13 inches) starts at $1000. The 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2000. The 16-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2500. So the missing MacBook is a 15-inch MacBook Air that starts at $1500. There must be some number of 16-inch MacBook Pro buyers who really do buy them <em>just</em> to get the big display, and they’d spend around $1000 less if a large-display consumer MacBook were available. But I can’t help but think Apple could make up for the lost revenue from those customers by upselling more MacBook Air buyers on a larger screen.</p>

<p>“The largest display option is only available in the pro models” is true for iPads and iPhones too, of course. But <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">rumors strongly suggest</a> that the iPhone 14 will appear with 6.1- and 6.7-inch sizes in both the Pro and non-Pro models. A big-screen non-Pro MacBook would follow that same pattern.</p>

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/03/google-routinely-hides-emails-from-litigation-by-ccing-attorneys-doj-alleges/">Jon Brodkin, writing for Ars Technica</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The US Department of Justice and 14 state attorneys general
yesterday asked a federal judge to sanction Google for misusing
attorney-client privilege to hide emails from litigation.</p>

<p>“In a program called ‘Communicate with Care,’ Google trains and
directs employees to add an attorney, a privilege label, and a
generic ‘request’ for counsel’s advice to shield sensitive
business communications, regardless of whether any legal advice is
actually needed or sought. Often, knowing the game, the in-house
counsel included in these Communicate-with-Care emails does not
respond at all,” the DOJ told the court. The fact that attorneys
often don’t reply to the emails “underscor[es] that these
communications are not genuine requests for legal advice but
rather an effort to hide potential evidence,” the DOJ said. [...]</p>

<p>CCing lawyers is a <a href="https://www.todaysgeneralcounsel.com/to-cc-or-not-to-cc-that-is-the-privilege-question/">common
practice</a>,
but the DOJ says Google took it to an “egregious” level. “Google’s
institutionalized manufacturing of false privilege claims is
egregious, spanning nearly a decade and permeating the company
from the top executives on down,” the DOJ said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without commenting on Google’s program or the specifics of the DOJ’s accusations, the broader issue makes me think about the nature of digital communication. Pre-email, business communication between colleagues was typically either in-person (not recorded), on the phone (not recorded), or via printed memoranda and reports (recorded, on paper). During a legal inquiry, printed memos could be subpoenaed or subject to discovery, and phone records could too. But telephone records only show who called whom, when, and for how long. The content of phone calls wasn’t (and still isn’t) recorded.</p>

<p>Email corresponds directly to the form of printed memos. That’s even where email lingo like “CC” and the “Subject” line comes from. (“CC” originally stood for “<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/carbon%20copy">carbon copy</a>”, which is how those copies were actually made — using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_paper">carbon paper</a>.) Emails are seemingly just like paper memos, only digital. But, because email is so much more profoundly convenient to use, both to send and receive, it quickly became more casual. Psychologically, using email for work <em>feels</em> a lot more like face-to-face conversations or phone calls. Many people with office jobs send thousands of emails per year at work. Only a maniac sent out thousands of printed memos per year pre-email.</p>

<p>I don’t think you have to be doing something immoral or on shaky legal footing to want to communicate with colleagues privately, without fear of those communications being exposed in future legal inquiries. Any sort of strategic deliberation is something you’d naturally want to remain forever private. So I get the basic desire. But I think a loose policy of just cc’ing company attorneys on we-want-this-to-remain-private emails is a poor strategy. The emails are still there. And the DOJ and state attorneys general can look at this behavior, see that the lawyers aren’t really involved in the discussions, and raise a stink about it, as they have with Google. Whatever the contents of those emails, this “Communicate With Care” program <em>looks</em> shady.</p>

<p>Last year, writing about a Phil Schiller email that was made public through discovery in the Epic v. Apple lawsuit, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut#fn1-2021-06-07">I asked a question in a footnote</a>:<sup id="fnr1-2022-03-24"><a href="#fn1-2022-03-24">1</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It really has all been email, too. Unless I’m missing something,
not one piece of communication entered into evidence — from
either Apple or Epic — has been anything other than an email
message. Not one message from iMessage or any other messaging
service. I find that very surprising. Do Apple executives never
use iMessage to discuss work? Nor Epic’s? If anyone with legal
expertise can explain why this is, let me know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got a few answers from readers. Basically, there’s little that would stop either side in a lawsuit from demanding access to private messages from services like iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, <s>Telegram,</s> etc. [Correction: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/25/telegram-encryption">Telegram should not be in that list</a>.] In criminal investigations, of course, law enforcement often does attempt to obtain such messages — law enforcement tries to obtain <em>everything</em>. But in many civil proceedings there’s an unspoken gentleperson’s agreement not to pursue such messages through discovery, being deemed too broad, too personal, too invasive. Technically, there’s a big difference between these services and email. Email is stored unencrypted on a server. The aforementioned messaging services are end-to-end encrypted. You’d have to get them from the individual parties’ devices — presuming they weren’t deleted.</p>

<p>So what I don’t get about Google’s “Communicate With Care” policy is why it involves email at all. Why not a policy recommending against using email, period, for anything deemed confidential? I get that Google is in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/">a uniquely awkward position</a> regarding post-email messaging services, but how about just using a service other than email that’s end-to-end encrypted? Or discussing all such matters in person or over voice? Part of me thinks this “Communicate With Care” policy at Google is just arrogant, but more than that, I think it’s just foolishly stubborn. If you don’t want it discovered, don’t put it in email.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/12/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-dismisses-privacy">as Eric Schmidt himself once advised</a>, “If you have something that you don’t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place.”</p>

<p>Speaking of footnotes, post-publication, a friend pointed me to at least one iMessage exchange that <em>was</em> entered into evidence in Epic v.

I can’t find a link online, but it was part of a trove of evidence that was briefly hosted on Box.com during the trial. I’ll host <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/PX-0276.pdf">a copy of the PDF here</a>.

<p>John Nack:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If anyone reads that New Yorker article and thinks they’ll prefer
shooting on an iPhone 7, please show them these iPhone 7-vs-12
shots I took.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a reference to Kyle Chayka’s “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/have-iphone-cameras-become-too-smart">Have iPhone Cameras Become Too Smart?</a>” article, which <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/22/chayka-iphone-smart">I commented on yesterday</a>. It’s coincidental that Nack’s year-ago series of comparison photos pitted the same two iPhones against each other that Chayka referenced. Chayka wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In January, I traded my iPhone 7 for an iPhone 12 Pro, and I’ve
been dismayed by the camera’s performance. On the 7, the slight
roughness of the images I took seemed like a logical product of
the camera’s limited capabilities. I didn’t mind imperfections
like the “digital noise” that occurred when a subject was underlit
or too far away, and I liked that any editing of photos was up to
me. On the 12 Pro, by contrast, the digital manipulations are
aggressive and unsolicited.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of times when new iPhones are reviewed — including my own reviews — camera comparisons are made to iPhones from just one or two years prior, and differences can seem subtle. Separate iPhones by five years, though, and the results are striking. (It’s pretty easy to tell in Nack’s gallery which photos are from which iPhone, but if you want to be certain, click the “(i)” button in Google Photos.)</p>

<p>How do you take a photo like <a href="https://glass.photo/gruber/7a69Jw8TdGXALPJYly0EFI">this</a> or <a href="https://glass.photo/gruber/1SQdgEk3GMbycs0zdKYH0J">this</a> — to pick two of my own recent photos taken with iPhone 13 Pro — with an iPhone 7? You can’t.</p>

	<summary type="text">I’ve been waiting years for Apple to release a good desktop display for under $2000, and in every single regard *other* than the camera, the Studio Display meets or exceeds my expectations.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>In the latter half of the 2010s, the Mac was having a bad time.</p>

<p>The small cylindrical Mac Pro introduced in 2013 was a dead end. The butterfly-switch keyboards used throughout the entire MacBook lineup were <a href="https://www.caseyjohnston.net/apple-keyboards/">prone</a> to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/apple-still-hasnt-fixed-its-macbook-keyboard-problem/">failure</a> (and, to most people’s tastes, didn’t have a good feel even when they were functioning perfectly). Apple’s most popular Mac, the MacBook Air, hadn’t been updated in years and lacked a retina display, making it look even more dated than it actually was (and it was quite dated). Apple stopped making standalone displays, assuming third-party display makers would fill the gap, and the gap was never filled with anything nearly approaching Apple’s own standards. Dependent on Intel, MacBooks were surpassed by iPads and even iPhones in chip performance — not just performance-per-watt but straight up speed. Apple’s iOS devices ran fast and cool and quiet; MacBooks, more and more, were running slow and hot and loud.</p>

<p>Not good.</p>

<p>But item by item, Apple started fixing what was wrong. The iMac Pro and then an all-new Mac Pro addressed everything wrong with the 2013 Mac Pro. Apple threw in the towel on revisions to the butterfly keyboards and shipped MacBooks with keyboards that are much more than merely reliable, they are downright great. They shipped a retina MacBook Air and people loved it. They moved the whole platform from Intel’s flailing x86 architecture to Apple silicon and stunned the industry with the results. They even recommitted to the Mac Mini, perhaps the most unassuming computer the company has ever made, but which plays an essential role in many workflows, both professional and consumer.</p>

<p>The final wrong Apple needed to make right was a standalone display. Yes, they started their return to the display market in 2019 with the $5000 (and up) Pro Display XDR, but that’s like saying a vehicle company that had only been making trucks returned to the car market with a $150,000 race car. What Mac users wanted was seemingly obvious. A bright high-quality display at least 27 inches in size with at least 5K resolution, and Apple-caliber color management. Good speakers and microphones. An array of ports and integration to fill the much-needed role of a big-screen docking station for MacBook users. And a good built-in camera.</p>

<p>The new Apple Studio Display aims to be just that. Alas, it falls woefully short in one of those regards.</p>

<h2 id="screen">Screen</h2>

<p>The screen itself is great. Plenty bright, wonderful color, very sharp, perfectly consistent from corner to corner, and at 27 inches is a nice big size. My review unit is the $1600 base model with the standard glossy finish and tilt-only base. On my desk, it’s the perfect height; if I had the model with the adjustable-height base, I’d probably set it at this exact height anyway. My office gets enough direct sunlight — more on this below, don’t you worry — that I’m considering the model with nano-texture glass for my own purchase, but even on sunny days the standard glossy finish’s anti-reflective coating is as effective at reducing glare and reflection as one could hope.</p>

<p>Sitting in front of it, there’s nothing to see except the screen itself and a half-inch thick black surrounding bezel. I love the way it looks.</p>

<h2 id="integration">Integration and Hardware Design</h2>

<p>Integration-wise, it’s very good. It has three USB-C ports with up to 10 Gb/s speed, and one Thunderbolt 3 port. That Thunderbolt port is the one you connect your Mac to, and if that Mac is a MacBook, it charges at up to 96 watts, which, I believe, is all you could ask for. Apple includes a 1-meter Thunderbolt cable with the Studio Display and it’s perfect — black, and a very nice braided fabric cable. I’ve spent most of the last week testing the Studio Display not with the Mac Studio, but with an Apple silicon MacBook Pro, which is how I intend to use it personally, and how most Mac users will too. Apple stopped breaking down Mac sales by desktop/laptop years ago, for competitive purposes, but it’s no secret the overwhelming majority of Macs sold today are MacBooks of some sort. I believe that number was at least 80 percent in 2021, and will only go higher this year, despite Apple’s desktop lineup being better than ever.</p>

<p>What I want from a desktop display for use with my MacBook is not to think about it. I want just one cable to plug in and out of my MacBook, and for everything to just work. When I plug the MacBook in, I want the display to just turn on and everything appear on screen at the size and position I expect. I want the MacBook to charge at a high speed through that one cable. When I want to take the MacBook away from the desk, I just want to unplug that one cable. That’s how the Studio Display works — for the most part. I personally do not like spanning across multiple displays, especially if they’re not the same size, so I keep my MacBook lid closed when connected to the Studio Display. A few times over the last week, upon connecting my MacBook Pro, the Studio Display turned on and my desktop picture was only 75 percent the size of the display, and the MacOS Dock was similarly confused about the size and resolution of the Studio Display. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/mis-sized-desktop.png">Here’s a screenshot</a> from a few days ago when this happened. The handful of times I ran into this, I could fix it simply by opening the MacBook’s lid (which triggers a rejiggering to turn on both displays) and then closing it again a few seconds later (which triggers another rejiggering to put everything back on the Studio Display as the sole active display). This seems like a glitch with MacOS 12, not the Studio Display in particular. I haven’t used a standalone display with my MacBooks in a few years, so I can’t say how common this is with other displays. But I expect perfection in this regard.</p>

<p>One thing that I greatly appreciate but is easy to take for granted is that the Studio Display does not require a power brick. It uses just a power cable with a simple prong at the end — which, like the aforementioned Thunderbolt cable, is black and made from the same nice braided fabric. Last year’s 24-inch M1 iMacs are strikingly thin in profile, but the cost of that remarkable thinness is that they require an external power brick that is pretty much the same size and weight as an Apple TV 4K. By my measurements, the 24-inch iMac display is about 11mm thick. The Studio Display is almost double that thickness: 19mm (~0.75 inches). That’s fine. The Studio Display is thin enough, and the extra thickness is well worth it for everything it provides, particularly the fact that it can charge a connected MacBook at 96 watts without using an external power brick.</p>

<p>There is no power button. There are no buttons on the Studio Display at all, in fact. It is subtle, but when on, the Studio Display is constantly blowing a small amount of air out the top and bottom. The aluminum frame never gets the least bit warm, and the cooling system makes no sound whatsoever. The tilting hinge works great — sturdy enough that it never budges accidentally while plugging something into a USB port, and loose enough that it’s easily adjustable when desired. I suppose I’d like a space gray (or dare I dream, even black) option in addition to silver, but otherwise I wouldn’t change a thing about how it looks. Form-factor- and integration-wise, the Studio Display approaches perfection.</p>

<h2 id="audio">Audio</h2>

<p>The built-in speakers sound great, and the built-in microphone array makes <em>you</em> sound good. Like many of Apple’s products with built-in speakers in recent years, they sound bigger, deeper, and clearer than possible given their size and inconspicuousness. There’s no need to wear headphones or use an external microphone during video chats (other than for privacy, obviously). In my testing, I sound better speaking into the Studio Display’s microphone array than I do using the microphones in my AirPod Pros.</p>

<h2 id="camera">Camera</h2>

<p>Which brings us to the camera, which I find to be crushingly disappointing. Image quality is astonishingly poor, and Center Stage is glitchy.</p>

<p>Apple says the Studio Display uses the same 12 megapixel ultra-wide camera as in recent iPads — including <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/03/the_2022_ipad_air">the new iPad Air</a>. Here are two images of me at my desk, on a sunny afternoon. This one is from the new iPad Air’s front-facing camera:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/camera-ipad-air.jpeg" class="noborder">

    alt="Me at my desk, on a sunny afternoon, shot using the 2022 iPad Air front-facing camera."
    width="500"
  /></a></p>

<p>This one is from the Studio Display:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/camera-studio-display.jpeg" class="noborder">
  <img
    src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/camera-studio-display.jpeg"
    alt="Me at my desk, on the same sunny afternoon, shot using the Studio Display camera."
    width="500"
  /></a></p>

<p>These two photos were taken seconds apart, in identical lighting. Yes that direct sunlight is harsh, but that’s where I sit, and the new iPad Air handles it well. The image from the Studio Display is terrible. And I’m not cherry-picking one bad image. I took dozens of photos, and the above is representative of the image quality you get from the Studio Display camera. These images, and the ones below, are also representative of the image quality during video calls.</p>

<p>One of these is from a $600 iPad. The other from a $1600 display. Both are using the same camera hardware. It doesn’t make sense that they look so different, and makes less sense that the one that looks like ass is from the $1600 product. Yes, the iPad Air has the M1’s image signal processor, and the Studio Display uses its built-in A13 chip’s ISP, and the M1 is better than the A13. But not <em>that</em> much better.</p>

<p>Even without harsh sunlight, all images from the Studio Display camera, in all lighting conditions, are grainy, lacking in contrast, and make skin tones look cadaveric. Here’s another comparison, taken at night.</p>

<p>iPhone SE (3rd generation), front-facing camera:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/camera-night-iphone-se.jpeg" class="noborder">
  <img
    src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/camera-night-iphone-se.jpeg"
    alt="Me at my desk at night, shot using the iPhone SE (3rd generation) front-facing camera."
    width="500"
  /></a></p>

<p>Studio Display:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/camera-night-studio-display.jpeg" class="noborder">
  <img
    src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/camera-night-studio-display.jpeg"
    alt="Me at my desk at night, shot using the Studio Display camera."
    width="500"
  /></a></p>

<p>Again, these two photos were taken seconds apart, under identical lighting.</p>

<p>Is the Studio Display camera unusable? No. I suppose it’s at least as good as the image quality from the camera on Apple silicon MacBooks. But that’s a low bar. MacBooks have thin lids, leaving very little room for cameras. The Studio Display is 0.75 inches thick. How can the image quality from the camera on a $1600 display be so much worse — laughably worse — than the image quality from a $600 iPad Air that uses the exact same camera hardware? Let alone comparing it to the front-facing camera on the $430 iPhone SE, which makes the Studio Display camera look like a toy. And we waited <em>years</em> for Apple to ship this display.</p>

<p>Again, it’s <em>usable</em>. All sorts of people use way worse cameras for videoconferencing every day. But this image quality is embarrassing from a company <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/01/25/om-iphone-camera">that considers itself <em>the</em> leading camera company in the world</a>. I’m not suggesting the Studio Display camera should match the quality of, say, the new iPhone SE’s <em>rear</em>-facing camera (but then again, why not?). I’m saying I expected the Studio Display camera to match the quality of, at least, the iPhone SE’s <em>front</em>-facing camera. I expected to be impressed by the Studio Display camera. Instead, I’m baffled. I don’t understand how this shipped.</p>

<p>It gets even worse. The Center Stage feature on the Studio Display should be called Off-Center Stage. Move around a bit or turn your head to the side and you get framed off to the side, even though you’re sitting directly in front of the center of the display. It takes up to 5 seconds for Center Stage to catch up and re-center you in the frame, which it does slowly and sheepishly, as though it’s embarrassed. On iPads with Center Stage, it’s like having a cameraperson following you around, reframing the image as you move. On the Studio Display, it’s as though that cameraperson is distracted, paying attention to something else, and then they realize, oops, you — the subject they’re supposed to be following — are framed poorly, and they sheepishly pan the camera to reframe you. Here’s an example screenshot from a FaceTime call:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/off-center-stage.jpeg" class="noborder">
  <img
    src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/off-center-stage.jpeg"
    alt="Example of poor framing from Center Stage during a FaceTime call."
    width="500"
  /></a></p>

<p>My face is dead center in front of the Studio Display here, and it took 4–5 seconds for Center Stage to reframe. Note too the deplorable image quality, in what should be nearly ideal lighting conditions.</p>

<p>I don’t really understand why Apple chose to support Center Stage with the Studio Display, and thus use this ultra-wide angle camera, in the first place. Center Stage feels clever and useful on iPads, which are often handheld and often positioned in all sorts of different angles and dynamic positions. But how is that a good choice for the camera on a big desktop display that isn’t intended to move around, and which you tend to sit in front of in a fixed position? Apple’s primary concern for the Studio Display camera should have been generating the best possible image quality for a single person at arm’s length in front of the screen, not Center Stage.</p>

<p>I shared my concerns and some of the above examples with Apple during my testing. Yesterday I was told by an Apple spokesperson that they’ve identified some issues where the Studio Display is not delivering the image quality they expected, and they will be making improvements in future software updates. (I feel like I could have written this paragraph before I even got that call.)</p>

<p>The Off-Center Stage thing is obviously a bug, and I expect that to be fixed. The overall image quality, I’ll bet, can and will be improved to <em>some</em> degree via software updates,<sup id="fnr1-2022-03-17"><a href="#fn1-2022-03-17">1</a></sup> but I’ll be surprised — happily surprised, but surprised — if a software update can turn this camera into something Apple should be proud of. Maybe, though, given that it’s the same camera hardware as the front-facing camera on the new iPad Air and last year’s iPad Pros. But I’m not holding my breath.</p>

<p>[<strong><span id="update-1">Update, seven hours after publication</span>:</strong> Maybe I <em>should</em> hold my breath. Multiple little birdies familiar with the Studio Display, each birdie independent of the others, tell me that the image quality problems really are a software problem, not hardware — a bug introduced at the last minute — and a future software update might not merely somewhat improve image quality, but raise it to a level commensurate with the iPad models equipped with the same camera (the new Air and last year’s Pros), modulo the differences between the M1 and A13 ISPs. That would be excellent news, if true. But someone at Apple is having a very bad day today, if true.]</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Studio Display doesn’t support ProMotion, but I honestly don’t know if ProMotion is technically feasible over Thunderbolt. Apple started shipping iPads with ProMotion support in 2017, and the 2019 Pro Display XDR — which costs $5000 — doesn’t support it either. What I really wish the Studio Display supported is Face ID. Apple’s biometric authentication story for Macs seems focused solely on Touch ID, so I’m not surprised that it doesn’t. But Touch ID on a desktop requires Apple’s Magic Keyboard, and alas for me, the Apple keyboard <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gruber/albums/72157604797968156/">I prefer</a>, and on which I’m writing these words, came out a few years before Touch ID was a thing.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that I find the camera crushingly disappointing,<sup id="fnr2-2022-03-17"><a href="#fn2-2022-03-17">2</a></sup> I’m almost certainly buying a Studio Display for myself. The Pro Display XDR doesn’t have a camera at all, and if the Studio Display didn’t have one either, I’d find that curious (and I’d have complained about it here), but I’d still buy it. And the Studio Display camera is better than having no built-in camera at all — it’s just disappointing. </p>

<p>I spent most of the space in this review discussing and illustrating my disappointment in the camera, but I don’t know how to say more to express my joy with, for example, the audio quality of the speakers and the visual quality of the screen. I’ve been waiting years for Apple to release a good desktop display for under $2000, and in every single regard <em>other</em> than the camera, the Studio Display meets or exceeds my expectations.</p>

<p>Here’s a weird thing. I started testing the Studio Display last Friday, using an M1 MacBook Pro running MacOS 12.2. The Studio Display officially requires MacOS 12.3, which didn’t ship until Monday this week. While running MacOS 12.2 over the weekend, there was no support for Center Stage, but, I swear, image quality from the camera was slightly better than what I’ve seen since testing it with Macs running MacOS 12.3. There was more contrast, for sure — images didn’t look quite so dreadfully flat and dull. I didn’t capture careful example photos while running 12.2, though, because I expected image quality to get better, if anything, after upgrading to the officially supported 12.3 release. The image quality difference I’m talking about here was subtle, not dramatic, so while I do think there’s room for the image quality to improve with future software updates, it doesn’t give me any hope that it will ever be good.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2022-03-17"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

	<summary type="text">Overall, when you look at the specs as they stand today, it seems like there should be just one 11-inch iPad Air or Pro. But that’s just the result of the tick-tock pattern of Apple’s iPad refresh cycle.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>The iPad family has sort of settled in to a consistent lineup for a few years, with five models. Three of them are distinctive:</p>

<ul>
<li>iPad, no adjective: the low cost one ($330 starting price)</li>
<li>iPad Mini: the small one ($500)</li>
<li>iPad Pro 13-inch: the big one, with the best specs ($1100)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want the cheapest, smallest, or biggest iPad, your decision is easy. But in the middle — where most people’s needs, desires, and budgets reside — choosing between the 11-inch iPad Pro and 10.9-inch iPad Air is not so easy. For one thing, they’re almost exactly the same size. What I call the “13-inch” iPad Pro above is officially 12.9 inches. I have never understood why Apple doesn’t want to call that “13 inches”. Go look at a ruler: a tenth of an inch (~2.5mm) is negligible.</p>

<p>But I <em>do</em> get why Apple wants to call the iPad Air’s size 10.9 inches instead of rounding that up to an even 11: side-by-side with the iPad Pro, you can see that the iPad Air has a slightly thicker bezel surrounding its thus slightly smaller display. But while their display sizes are slightly different, their case dimensions are effectively identical. The only difference is that the Air is 0.2mm thicker — close enough that they both fit the same Magic Keyboard, just different enough that Apple makes separate Smart Folio covers for each. But practically speaking, they’re the same size.</p>

<p>As usual, Apple’s online “Compare” page is exemplary for examining their differences. <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/?modelList=ipad-air-5th-gen,ipad-pro-11-3rd-gen,ipad-air-4th-gen">Here’s a link to the Compare page listing three iPads</a>: the new 5th-generation iPad Air (which I’ve been testing since last week), the 3rd generation 11-inch iPad Pro (which <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/05/the_2021_m1_ipad_pros">debuted in May last year</a>), and the now-discontinued 4th-generation iPad Air (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/10/the_2020_ipad_air">which debuted in October 2020</a>). I’ve also saved a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/ipad-air5-pro3-air4-compare.pdf">PDF of this three-way comparison</a> for posterity.</p>

<p>Most of the differences between the new iPad Air and last year’s iPad Pro — and the differences between the new iPad Air and the 2020 iPad Air — are easily discerned from that page. Highlights, to my thinking: the iPad Pro has Face ID, and the new iPad Air still has Touch ID on the power button; only the iPad Pro display supports ProMotion;<sup id="fnr1-2022-03-16"><a href="#fn1-2022-03-16">1</a></sup> both support 5G cellular networking but only the iPad Pro supports mmWave (a.k.a. ultra wideband). The iPad Pro has four speakers, but the iPad Air still only two. In landscape this means the Air only has speakers on one side of the display; in portrait, only on the bottom.</p>

<p>On the flip side, the iPad Air comes in fun colors — my review unit is blue and everyone here at DF HQ agrees it’s comely. The iPad Pro only comes in silver or space gray.</p>

<p>But what isn’t quite as discernible are the differences in price. The iPad Air base model starts at $600 and the iPad Pro at $800, but that’s not a gigabyte-to-gigabyte comparison. Here’s the full pricing table:</p>

<p><small>* These models come with 16 GB of memory; the others all come with 8 GB.</small></p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/10/the_2020_ipad_air">Once again</a>, the iPad Air and iPad Pro only share a single storage tier: 256 GB, and at 256 GB, the price difference is just $150. (The extra $50 charge for cellular networking on iPad Pro is the price you pay for mmWave support. Those Qualcomm modems aren’t free and Apple isn’t eating the cost.)</p>

<p>If you really need or want 1–2 TB of storage and/or double the RAM, your choice is made for you, but you’ll pay at least double the price of the 256 GB iPad Air. If not — and the vast majority of iPad users, even serious ones, should do just fine with 256 GB of storage and the default 8 GB of RAM — the question is whether the iPad Pro is worth $150 extra.</p>

<p>For <em>me</em>, Face ID alone is worth $150. I use my iPad in a Magic Keyboard frequently, perhaps even a majority of the time. It’s my kitchen computer. And I find using Touch ID on the power button somewhat awkward when the iPad Air is in the Magic Keyboard. But the Magic Keyboard is a $300 peripheral. It’s not a niche product but it’s certainly not for everyone. iPads are fundamentally handheld tablets, and handheld, the iPad Air’s Touch ID instead of Face ID is much less of a difference. I still decidedly prefer Face ID, though. Touch ID on the iPad Air makes it feel easy to unlock. Face ID on the iPad Pro makes it seems like it wasn’t even locked in the first place.</p>

<p>Overall, when you look at the specs as they stand today, it seems like there should be just one 11-inch iPad Air or Pro. But that’s just the result of the tick-tock pattern of Apple’s iPad refresh cycle. None of the models in the iPad family are on annual refresh cycles like iPhones are. Because all new iPhones — SE models excepted — debut alongside each other every September, the overall iPhone product matrix makes sense continuously. With most iPad models getting updated roughly every 18 months, but with the iPads Pro and iPad Air on opposite sides of the calendar, the comparisons are never quite aligned. Right now, with the brand-new iPad Air upgraded to the same M1 chip that’s in the iPad Pro, it looks like there’s little reason for the 11-inch iPad Pro to exist. Apple could add a few higher-capacity storage options for the iPad Air, add Face ID, and make it the one and only “11-inch” mid-to-high-end iPad.</p>

<p>But wait until later this year, probably October, and if the iPads Pro get refreshed — as one would expect not just from the rumor mill, but by looking at Apple’s historic pattern — all of a sudden the differences between the iPad Air and iPad Pro should be much more profound. And then a year later in the fall of 2023, there will likely come a 6th-generation iPad Air that will significantly close the gap again. That’s how it goes. Or at least that’s how it’s been going for the last few cycles.</p>

<p>Right now, though, the new iPad Air is a lovely device. And if your iPad usage is such that you really don’t need more than 64 GB of storage, at $600 (or $750 with cellular<sup id="fnr2-2022-03-16"><a href="#fn2-2022-03-16">2</a></sup>), it’s a veritable bargain.</p>

<p>My biggest gripe remains unchanged from all recent iPad models: the front-facing camera placement is awkward when the iPad is oriented in landscape, but landscape is how the iPad is oriented when it’s in a Magic Keyboard <em>or</em> propped up using a folded Smart Folio cover — and those are the natural ways to use an iPad for a video chat at a desk or on a counter. It’s a great camera (and the M1 has an excellent image signal processor), but horizontally, you wind up with a high-quality image of yourself from a bad angle. The camera is too low and off to the side. If you look at the camera you’re not looking at the screen, and if you look at the screen the camera makes it look like you’re <em>not</em> looking at the screen. I don’t know what the solution to this problem is, but Apple hasn’t found it yet.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>The biggest institutional difference between Apple and Microsoft is, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2471632/steve-jobs-on-microsoft---they-just-have-no-taste--.html">famously</a>, taste. Another, though, is their contrasting approaches to backward compatibility. Microsoft <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031015-00/?p=42163">bends over backward to maintain it</a> and <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20061106-01/?p=29123">their customers thank them for it</a>. Apple eschews it when they see a better way forward, and their users gripe about it and then get over it.<sup id="fnr1-2022-03-15"><a href="#fn1-2022-03-15">1</a></sup></p>

<p>But one reason for this institutional difference isn’t merely company culture; it’s size. Microsoft, historically, was big; Apple, relatively speaking, small. Backward compatibility is a big company thing — or, better put, a big customer base thing. With enough total customers and an addressable market of “almost everyone”, there inevitably is going to be a sizable segment demanding backward compatibility.</p>

<p>Apple today, of course, is big. And while the Mac and iPad and Apple Watch are all big and growing, Apple sits atop <a href="https://americanbusinesshistory.org/most-valuable-companies-the-last-25-years/">the world’s market cap list</a> today because of the iPhone, and the iPhone customer base is simply enormous. I, for one, admit that my mind isn’t capable of fully grasping just how many people in the world use iPhones, nor how many new iPhones Apple sells each month, each week, each day, each hour. Apple doesn’t serve this enormous market by making dozens and dozens of different models — or even a single dozen. Go to Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone page</a> and they list just <em>five</em> fundamental models in the header navigation. Five!</p>

<ul>
<li>iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max</li>
<li>iPhone 13 and 13 Mini</li>
<li>iPhone 12 and 12 Mini</li>
<li>iPhone 11</li>
</ul>

<p>And, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/iphone-march-2022-header.png">right in the middle of that list</a>, the iPhone SE. The middle of the list is where it belongs — the newest in some ways, the oldest in others.</p>

<p>Every other model in the iPhone lineup follows the design paradigm of the iPhone X, which was introduced in September 2017, which was a lifetime ago in iPhone years. Edge-to-edge round-cornered OLED displays, Face ID, and a gestural interface for navigating the entire system.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULu8quXtOak">One of these things is not like the others</a>, and that’s the iPhone SE, with its forehead and chin above and below its square-cornered LCD display, and a Home button interface with Touch ID. Even putting Face ID vs. Touch ID aside — a big difference to put aside — the Home button embodies a fundamentally different interaction model for the iPhone. It was <em>weird</em> switching to the iPhone X after a decade using Home-button iPhones. It is even weirder now, going back to it, as I have since Friday, testing the new third generation iPhone SE. I even forgot how to take screenshots.<sup id="fnr2-2022-03-15"><a href="#fn2-2022-03-15">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Even before I got accustomed to the iPhone X’s fundamental changes to the interaction model, I was convinced Apple had designed something better, not merely something different. Four years later, I suspect just about everyone reading this would agree. The Home button interaction is almost spectacularly simple, which was exactly the right design in the early years of the iPhone, when it sounded crazy that you could do everything from email to web browsing to calendaring to you-name-it, all on your <em>phone</em>, the little thing that goes in your pants pocket. So many features — infinite features, really — but no matter what you did, how deep into any app you got, you were one hardware button click away from going home, to a simple grid of app icons. The iPhone supported multitasking a few years into the Home button era, but it was an interaction model that felt naturally suited to doing one thing at a time. Do one thing, go back home, then do another thing or put the phone down. The iPhone X model is fluid and feels naturally suited to a mental model of flowing between multiple apps. It was a bold move to make a change so fundamental to a product so insanely popular, but clearly the right one. I won’t rehash more of this, as I’ll only repeat myself from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/the_2020_iphone_se">my review of the 2020 iPhone SE</a>.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing: some people don’t like bold moves, even if they’re good. For some people — many of them, but make no mistake definitely not all, older — <em>familiarity</em> trumps all. The technotariat class may think it offensive or spiteful or just plain goofy that Apple’s entry model iPhone looks and feels half a decade old. It even still has just one frigging camera on the back, with a lens so unassuming it barely juts out. But that’s what many people want: a new iPhone that looks and works like the one they already know and understand and feel comfortable with.</p>

<p>What would be nice, though, they’d all agree, is if it were faster and had longer battery life and took better photos, even if only moderately so. Not the best photos from any phone on the market — just better than the ones on whatever phone they’ve been using. That’s the iPhone SE. It literally has the fastest chip of any phone from any company at any price, the A15. But that’s not what matters to potential iPhone SE buyers. That’s almost a negative point for them — “the fastest phone chip in the world” sounds to them like something they don’t need. What matters is that the A15 is the most efficient phone chip in the world, too. It should last noticeably longer — hours longer — in typical use compared to the 2020 iPhone SE, and <em>much</em> longer than the several-years-old phones with depleted batteries most iPhone SE buyers are likely replacing. After last week’s announcement, I saw many nerds on Twitter — people who clearly had no interest themselves in buying the iPhone SE — griping that it’s downright wrong for Apple to put a “faster” chip in the same old form factor without greatly increasing the capacity of the battery. Too many nerds have internalized the way it used to be, that when chips got faster they necessarily consumed more power. Apple silicon has fundamentally changed that equation. The A15 in the new third-gen iPhone SE is both faster <em>and</em> more power efficient than the A13 in the second-gen iPhone SE. But more importantly, the sort of people who bought the second-gen iPhone SE aren’t in the market to replace them yet, and won’t be for a few years. Folks buying this new iPhone will be coming from phones like the iPhone 7 and 8, if not older.</p>

<p>The camera hardware is unchanged from the 2020 SE, but the image quality of photos is superior because so much of image quality from phone cameras comes from the image signal processing on the chips, and the A15’s ISP produces noticeably superior results.</p>

<p>I do hear a tiny little trombone playing a sad <em>wah-wah</em>, and that tune is playing because the price for the new iPhone SE has gone up by $30 at each storage tier: $430/$480/$580 for 64/128/256 GB of storage. That seems to be standard for Apple’s pricing for each device that goes from LTE to 5G cellular networking, with the exception of the iPhone Pro models — the most expensive iPhones. There’s a reason why Apple fought Qualcomm tooth-and-nail in court <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/04/why_apple_settled_with_qualcomm">before throwing in the towel and settling in 2019</a>, and there’s a reason Apple is working its ass off to <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/618603/apples-first-5g-modem-may-compete-with-qualcomms-snapdragon-x70.html">make its own 5G modems</a>. Qualcomm charges a premium for their 5G modems because they’re the best. Apple, of all companies, understands that.</p>

<p>I don’t think this $30 price increase will hurt sales, even with the SE — the iPhone that clearly is targeted at the most price-sensitive potential customers. For one thing, inflation is everywhere at the moment. An extra $30 for an iPhone is nothing compared to what’s going on in the car market. But more importantly, I think many, if not most, of the people who will buy an iPhone SE in the next few years aren’t going to pay for it up front. Go to a carrier’s product page for the new SE, e.g. <a href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/apple-iphone-se-3rd-gen-2022-64gb-midnight.html?q=iphone%20se">AT&amp;T’s</a> or <a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/apple-iphone-se-2022/?sku=sku5230177">Verizon’s</a>, and they don’t tell you the up-front price other than in tiny gray small print. They tell you it costs $12/month. They do this with all phones they sell, not just the iPhone SE, but that’s how many people buy phones today. They’re advertising them on installment plans because it works.</p>

<p>The most interesting question to me is not whether Apple should have switched this generation of iPhone SE to the iPhone X interaction model, but whether they’ll even change it with the <em>next</em> SE model two or three years from now. There is a profound thoughtfulness and longevity to this design. Like an all-time great athlete, years past their prime, but still pulling their weight on the team, contributing something essential. This is backward compatibility Apple-style — not <em>technical</em> compatibility, but <em>experience</em> compatibility. The iPhone SE is the comfort iPhone.</p>

I tried pressing power + volume an embarrassing number of times, thinking I’d run into a bug, that snapping screenshots was broken on the new SE in iOS 15.4, before remembering that the screenshot buttons changed with iPhone X by necessity, because the Home button was removed.
